# Rossler-system
The Rössler system is an adaptation of the Lorentz model, where 𝑎, 𝑏 and 𝑐 are constant parameters. Considering 𝑎 = 𝑏 = 0.2, determine: \  a) The bifurcation map of the system according to parameter 𝑐; \ b) The format of the strange attractor when the system is not periodic; \ c) The Lorenz Map for this strange attractor.
